## Running the convert watcher and local web preview

Use the Files app to navigate to the `pali-sutta-readings.github.io-source`
folder, cloned from Github.

Right click > Open Terminal

Start the convert watcher process:

```
make convert
```

NOTE: The script creates watchers for existing `.org` files. When creating new
file `.org` file in VS Code, stop the watcher with `Ctrl + C` and start it
again, so that the new file is also watched.

Open a new terminal tab with `Ctrl + Shift + T`

Start the local web preview:

```
make preview
```

Open <https://localhost:8000>

## Publish on the github.io website 

```
make publish
```

This commits and pushes (uploads) changes in both the `source` and `main` branch.

## Editing tips

To mark a page as draft (i.e. not published on Github), insert on top:

``` org
#+draft: t
```

An org heading with the `:noexport:` tag is always excluded, never rendered to HTML.

``` org
* Notes :noexport:

Clipped texts and other research notes.
```

An org heading with the `:noprint:` tag is rendered to HTML on the sessions's web page, but is excluded on the `.../readings-print/...` url.

<https://pali-sutta-readings.github.io/readings/2025-03-05/>\\
<https://pali-sutta-readings.github.io/readings-print/2025-03-05/>

This is useful for creating the PDF for printing.

``` org
* 2025-03-05
** AN 1.11

Sutta text, vocabulary, for printing.

**** Notes :noprint:

Useful notes to include on the web page but not for printing.

** AN 2.22

Another text for printing.
```

A page break can be inserted in the print view:

``` org
#+html: <div class="pagebreak"></div>
```

## Command line tools

```
pipx install poetry
sudo apt install pandoc inotify-tools xclip
```
