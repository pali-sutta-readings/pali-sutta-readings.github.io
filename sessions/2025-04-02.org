santi, bho gotama, eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṁvādino evaṁdiṭṭhino: 

yaṁ kiñcāyaṁ purisapuggalo paṭisaṁvedeti sukhaṁ vā dukkhaṁ vā adukkhamasukhaṁ vā

sabbaṁ taṁ pubbekatahetū ti. Idha bhavaṁ gotamo kimāhā ti?

Pittasamuṭṭhānānipi kho, sīvaka, idhekaccāni vedayitāni uppajjanti.

Sāmampi kho etaṁ, sīvaka, veditabbaṁ ... Lokassapi kho etaṁ, sīvaka, saccasammataṁ

yathā pittasamuṭṭhānānipi idhekaccāni vedayitāni uppajjanti. 

Tatra, sīvaka, ye te samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṁvādino evaṁdiṭṭhino ...

Yañca sāmaṁ ñātaṁ tañca atidhāvanti, yañca loke saccasammataṁ tañca atidhāvanti.

Tasmā tesaṁ samaṇabrāhmaṇānaṁ micchāti vadāmi.

Semhasamuṭṭhānānipi … vātasamuṭṭhānānipi … sannipātikānipi … utupariṇāmajānipi …

visamaparihārajānipi … opakkamikānipi … kammavipākajānipi idhekaccāni vedayitāni uppajjanti.

Structure: The passage uses repetitive phrasing to emphasize multiple causes of feelings (vedayitāni), 
contrasting with the view that all experiences stem solely from past karma (as the sole cause).

Medical Context: Terms like pitta (bile), semha (phlegm), and vāta (wind) reflect an ancient Indian 
humors theory akin to Ayurveda, showing a naturalistic explanation for some feelings.

Philosophical Point: The Buddha critiques the deterministic view of certain ascetics and Brahmins 
who overstep (atidhāvanti) both personal experience and common knowledge.
