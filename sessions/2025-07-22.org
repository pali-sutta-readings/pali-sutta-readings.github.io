slants, slopes, and inclines to Nibbāna.

“Then the Tathāgata trains him further: ‘Come, monk, remain focused on the body
in & of itself, but do not think any thoughts connected with the body. Remain
focused on feelings in & of themselves, but do not think any thoughts connected
with feelings. Remain focused on the mind in & of itself, but do not think any
thoughts connected with mind. Remain focused on mental qualities in & of
themselves, but do not think any thoughts connected with mental qualities.’ With

([[https://seeingthroughthenet.github.io/nibbana-the-mind-stilled/sermon-29.html][Nibbāna Sermon 29]]) What, dear sir, is the cause of desire ...? Desire, O King
of Gods, has thinking as its cause, it arises with thinking, it has thinking as
its origin. When thinking is there, desire comes to be; when thinking is not
there, desire does not come to be!

What is the cause, the arising and the origin of thinking?

Reckonings born of prolific perception /papañcasaññāsaṅkhā/, but feelings and
thinking are of two kinds, one inclines to papañca, the other inclines toward
Nibbāna.

arahant has no notion of a body. That is, he does not have a perception of a
body, like that of a worldling, who takes it as such, due to his perception of
the compact, /ghanasaññā/. [...] Similarly, that mind is not there, /so mano na
hoti/. It is only the collocation of preparations which arise and cease that is
conceived as ‘my mind’. Therefore, whatever field, site, base or reason, owing
to which there can arise inward pleasure or pain, is no longer there.

** Canonical jhāna VS Visuddhimagga / Commentarial jhāna

In the canonical suttas, abandoning the hindrances leads to /sammā-samādhi/,
which is described as the four /jhānas/, hence they are an integral part of the
Path which leads to the cessation of /dukkha/, and the texts confirm that
practising them is leading to Nibbāna (e.g. DN 29).

The suttas also describe the four formless attainments (/āruppa, arūpa
samāpatti, "vimokkhā atikkamma rūpe āruppā"/) which are available for meditators
but are not necessary for the Path, and (the attainments in themselves) are not
leading to Nibbāna. (MN 26: /nāyaṁ dhammo ... na sambodhāya na nibbānāya
saṁvattati/).

See also /vimokkha/ in [[https://www.budsas.org/ebud/bud-dict/dic3_v.htm][Nyanatiloka's Buddhist Dictionary]] for /aṭṭha vimokkhā/,
the eight liberations, the 8th being /nirodha-samāpatti/.

The Visuddhimagga introduced the /samatha/ VS /vipassana/ practice as distinct
categories, including the four /jhānas/ and four /āruppa/ formless attainments
in /samatha/. Due to this mixing of categories, /jhāna/ came to include the
/āruppas/, sometimes referred to as /arūpa-jhānas/ in the Visuddhimagga.

(The term /arūpa-jhāna/ does not exist in the suttas, since the canonical
/jhāna/ does not include the /arūpa samāpatti/ attainments.)

From this originates the commentarial notion of /sukkha-vipassaka/ (dry-insight) /arahants/, who
attain awakening without experiencing /jhānas/ -- but this /jhāna/ refers to the
/āruppas/, which were not part of the canonical term /jhāna/.

The Visuddhimagga also introduced the terms of /khaṇika-/ (momentary),
/upacāra-/ (access/neighbourhood), and /appanā-samādhi/ (fixed/absorption)
concentration as another way of categorizing states and degrees of absorptions.

#+begin_quote
jhāna is not one-pointedness
jhāna, sammā samādhi
are the outcome of developing the other path factors (e.g., MN I.356-7, SN
V.21, AN IV.40, DN II.216-7, DN III.252-3, AN V.212):

Bhikkhus I shall teach you noble right samadhi with its support and requisites... What
bhikkhus is noble right samadhi with its support and requisites, that is, right view, right
intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness?
Unification of mind equipped with these seven factors is called noble right samadhi with
its support and requisites. [MN III.71]

unperturbable -- can't hear

Aj Thanissaro jhāna talk
- In "Thinking About Jhana", Ajahn Thanissaro notes that, though vitakka-vicara are present in the 1st jhana, only terms of metacognition, ie. paṭisañcikati (reflects), discerns (pajājāti), and paccavekkheyye (reflect), regards (samanupassati) are present in the later ones. Metacognition involves taking a step back from your mental activity and deciding whether it's worth doing, and is for the purpose of dispassion and relinquishment in Buddhism. Ie. from MN 52, "He reflects (paṭisañcikati) on this and discerns (pajānāti), 'This second jhāna is fabricated & intended. Now whatever is fabricated & intended is inconstant & subject to cessation.' Staying right there, he reaches the ending of the effluents."

- It is also emphasized that jhāna is something rather special and profound: >"The range of jhāna, monks, cannot be conceived of; it should not be explored in thought. Anyone exploring it would partake of madness and distress."

- In the Pāsādika-sutta (D 29; DN III 132) it is emphasized that the four jhānas are practices involving happiness that lead to full disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, higher knowledge, full awakening, and nibbāna.

Fourth, in the suttas, the “formless attainments” (arupa samapattis) are never called
“arupa jhanas”. This is a later designation. Furthermore, while the suttas clearly state that
the “formless attainments” do not lead to nibbana [MN I 165-6], there are various statements
in the suttas, that the four jhanas are conducive to awakening, and that they are the unique
teaching of the Buddha
