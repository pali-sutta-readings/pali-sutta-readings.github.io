This passage is particularly significant as it shows the contrasting reactions 
to the Buddha's parinibbāna between those who had and hadn't attained liberation, 
and includes Subhadda's controversial statement that later became one of the 
causes for the First Buddhist Council.

Note: Aṭṭhamī Pūjā, also known as "Paying Respect on the Eighth Day," commemorates 
the cremation of the Buddha's body on the eighth day after Visākha Pūjā (a major 
Buddhist festival celebrating the Buddha's birth, enlightenment, and death). It's 
a lesser-known festival compared to Visākha Pūjā and is not recognized as a public 
holiday in many places.

It is disintegrating, bhikkhu, therefore it is called the world. And what is disintegrating? The eye, bhikkhu, is disintegrating, forms are disintegrating, eye-consciousness is disintegrating ...

... And if a person who was being swept along by the current grabbed the wild
sugarcane, kusa grass, reeds, vetiver, or trees, it’d break off, and they’d come
to ruin because of that.

Tassā puriso sotena vuyhamāno kāse cepi gaṇheyya, te palujjeyyuṁ. So tatonidānaṁ
anayabyasanaṁ āpajjeyya.

Evameva kho, bhikkhave, assutavā puthujjano ... rūpaṁ / vedanaṁ / saññaṁ /
saṅkhāre / viññāṇaṁ attato samanupassati ... Tassa taṁ rūpaṁ palujjati. So
tatonidānaṁ anayabyasanaṁ āpajjati.

The ordinary person ... assumes form to be the self ... That form tears away
from him, and so from that cause he would come to disaster.
