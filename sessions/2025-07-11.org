** Timeline of the development of the Vinaya

| 498 BCE       | Bodh Gaya, India       | *Enlightenment of the Buddha* - *Siddhārtha Gautama* attains enlightenment under the Bodhi tree, marking the beginning of his teaching career and the foundation for all Buddhist texts including the Vinaya.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -             | India                  | *The First Pārājika* - The Buddha establishes the first major monastic rule (Pr 1), beginning the gradual formation of the monastic code. This marks the origin of the Vinaya as a living system of rules developed in response to actual situations.                                                                                                                             |
| 543 BCE       | Kushinagar, India      | *Parinibbāna of the Buddha* - The Buddha's passing away, after which the preservation and compilation of his teachings, including the Vinaya rules, becomes crucial for survival of the Sangha.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 543 BCE       | Rājagaha, India        | *First Council* - *Ven. Mahākassapa* presides over the council where *Ven. Upāli* recites the entire Vinaya from memory. This is the first formal compilation of the Vinaya rules, establishing the oral tradition.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 383 BCE       | Vesālī, India          | *Second Council* - Convened to address disputes over Vinaya interpretation, particularly the "Ten Points" controversy regarding monastic practices. This council reinforced the importance of strict Vinaya observance.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 250 BCE       | Pāṭaliputta, India     | *Third Council* - Held under *Emperor Asoka's* patronage, this council further refined the Vinaya texts and established the version that would be transmitted to other countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 247 BCE       | Mihintale, Sri Lanka   | *Ven. Mahinda's Mission* - Emperor Asoka's son brings Buddhism to Sri Lanka, establishing the Theravāda tradition that would preserve the Pāli Vinaya texts.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2nd c. BCE    | Sri Lanka              | *The Core Vinaya Texts* - The *Sutta Vibhaṅga* (analysis of rules for monks and nuns) and *Khandakas* (institutional rules) are established in their canonical form. The Khandakas include the *Mahāvagga* (dealing with upasampadā, uposatha, etc.) and *Cūlavagga* (covering disciplinary procedures).                                                                         |
| 1st c. BCE    | Aluvihāra, Sri Lanka   | *Writing Down of the Tipitaka* - The Pāli Canon, including the Vinaya, is committed to writing for the first time on palm leaves, preserving the oral tradition in written form during a time of famine and political instability.                                                                                                                                               |
