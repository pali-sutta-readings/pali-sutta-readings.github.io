| Yo santaṁ attani pāpaṁ, attānaṁ parigūhasi. | you conceal the evil self existing within yourself. |
| Passanti devā ca tathāgatā ca, Lokasmiṁ bālaṁ visamaṁ carantaṁ; | The devas and Tathāgatas see the fool acting unrighteously in the world. |
| Tasmā hi attādhipateyyako ca, Lokādhipo ca nipako ca jhāyī; | Therefore one should fare mindfully, taking oneself as authority; alert and meditative, taking the world as authority; |
| Dhammādhipo ca anudhammacārī, Na hīyati saccaparakkamo muni. | and fare in accordance with the Dhamma, taking the Dhamma as authority. Truly exerting himself, a sage does not decline. |
| Pasayha māraṁ abhibhuyya antakaṁ, Yo ca phusī jātikkhayaṁ padhānavā; | Having vanquished Māra and overcome the end-maker, the striver has finished with birth. |
