* Pāli Sutta Readings

Source branch of [[https://pali-sutta-readings.github.io][pali-sutta-readings.github.io]]

** Setup for editing

Clone the repository twice, one folder for the ~source~ branch where you edit,
one folder for the ~main~ branch where the HTML is generated.

#+begin_src
git clone -b source git@github.com:pali-sutta-readings/pali-sutta-readings.github.io.git pali-sutta-readings.github.io-source

git clone -b main git@github.com:pali-sutta-readings/pali-sutta-readings.github.io.git pali-sutta-readings.github.io-main
#+end_src

Set your git merge strategy preference:

: git config --global pull.rebase false

Command line tools:

: pipx install poetry
: sudo apt install pandoc inotify-tools xclip

If needed, update your ~pandoc~ version from the github releases: https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases

For Ubuntu Linux, download the ...-amd64.deb, then install with:

: sudo dpkg -i ...-amd64.deb

In the ~-source~ folder, install the Python packages.

#+begin_src
cd pali-sutta-readings.github.io-source
poetry install
#+end_src

In one terminal, start a converter process:

: make convert

In another terminal, start a preview process:

: make preview

Open [[https://localhost:8000]] to see your changes.

Stop either process with ~Ctrl + C~.

If you create new org-mode notes, the converter has to be stopped and started again, so that it also watches the new org file.

You can start notes for a reading session by creating a new file in the ~sessions/~ folder, e.g. ~sessions/2025-05-01.org~. See the *Editing tips* section below.

** Running the convert watcher and local web preview

Use the Files app to navigate to the =pali-sutta-readings.github.io-source= folder, cloned from Github.

Right click > Open Terminal

Start the convert watcher process:

: make convert

NOTE: The script creates watchers for existing =.org= files. When creating new file =.org= file in VS Code, stop the watcher with =Ctrl + C= and start it again, so that the new file is also watched.

Open a new terminal tab with =Ctrl + Shift + T=

Start the local web preview:

: make preview

Open [[https://localhost:8000]]

** Publish on the github.io website

: make publish

This commits and pushes (uploads) changes in both the =source= and =main= branch.

** Editing tips

To mark a page as draft (i.e. not published on Github), insert on top:

: #+draft: t

An org heading with the =:noexport:= tag is always excluded, never rendered to HTML.

#+begin_src org
,* Notes :noexport:

Clipped texts and other research notes.
#+end_src

An org heading with the =:noprint:= tag is rendered to HTML on the sessions's web page, but is excluded on the =.../readings-print/...= url.

[[https://pali-sutta-readings.github.io/readings-print/2025-03-05/]]

This is useful for creating the PDF for printing.
